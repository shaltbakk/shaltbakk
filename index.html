    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>My name is Sindre, I am from Norway. I moved to Illinois this previous August, however, I have lived in Florida for approximately 6 years. 
        I hold an Airline Transport Pilot certificate, and will be pursuing my career in aviation this spring. 
        My family is back home in Norway, in addition to my parents I have 4 older siblings, 10 nieces/nephews with ages ranging from 7-20 years old. 
        When the whole family meets up we are almost 30 people!
        My major is Aviation Administration.     </p>
